>This folder contains soil sensors data collected/generated by Aditi Sengupta, Stephanie Pennington and James Stegen with new plot names.
>Data points range from 7 November 2018 - 27 September 2019. I would drop the first 2 days in November since the sensors were installed at that time and it sometimes takes a few days for the sensors to report stabilized values. 

>The sensor IDs correspond to:

PLOT		ID
Freshwater	06-02181
Salt            06-02171
Control	        06-02561
Shore1          06-02526
Shore2          06-02503

>Sensors are labeled as XY-AB, where X is plot (C=control, S=salt, F=fresh, Sh1=shoreline1, Sh2=shoreline2), Y=tree number, AB is depth below soil surface where sensors are installed; 3=3 cm, 12=12 cm, and 36=36 cm).
For example, C6-36 implies control plot tree number 3 with sensor at 36 cm below soil surface.
